CharityDistribution DAO
Project Description
CharityDistribution DAO is a transparent charity platform with community voting on fund allocation and impact tracking. Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) empowers communities to collectively decide how charitable funds should be distributed while maintaining complete transparency and accountability.

The platform allows contributors to deposit funds into a shared charity pool and receive governance tokens that enable them to participate in decision-making. Community members can propose charitable causes, and token holders vote on which proposals should receive funding. All transactions and votes are recorded on-chain, ensuring maximum transparency and trust.

Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize charitable giving through blockchain technology, creating a trustless, transparent, and democratic platform where:

Community-Driven Impact: Every donation decision is made collectively by the community, not by centralized authorities
Complete Transparency: All fund movements, proposals, and votes are publicly verifiable on the blockchain
Democratic Governance: Voting power is proportional to contributions, ensuring those who invest more have a stronger voice
Global Accessibility: Anyone, anywhere can participate in charitable giving without geographical or institutional barriers
Accountability: Smart contracts ensure funds are only released when proposals meet community approval
Trust Through Code: Eliminate the need for trust in intermediaries by relying on immutable smart contract logic
We envision a world where charitable organizations and causes can receive funding based on genuine community support, where donors can track exactly how their contributions are used, and where the impact of charitable giving is maximized through collective wisdom.

Core Smart Contract Functions
create-charity-proposal
Creates new charity funding proposals with the following parameters:

title: Brief description of the charitable cause
description: Detailed explanation of the proposal
recipient: Principal address that will receive the funds
amount: Requested funding amount in STX
vote-on-proposal
Enables token holders to vote on active proposals:

proposal-id: Unique identifier for the proposal
vote-for: Boolean indicating support (true) or opposition (false)
Voting power is determined by governance token balance
Data Structures
charity-proposals: Stores all proposal details and voting results
member-votes: Tracks individual votes to prevent double-voting
member-contributions: Records contribution history for transparency
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Stacks wallet (Hiro Wallet recommended)
STX tokens for contributions and transaction fees
Access to Stacks testnet or mainnet
Deployment
Deploy the smart contract to Stacks blockchain
Initialize the contract with owner permissions
Add initial charity funds using add-charity-funds
Mint governance tokens for initial contributors
Usage
Contributing: Send STX to receive governance tokens
Proposing: Create proposals for charitable causes
Voting: Use governance tokens to vote on active proposals
Tracking: Monitor proposal status and fund distributions
Contract Address Details
Contract address information will be added upon deployment to mainnet/testnet

Mainnet Address: [To be added]

Security Considerations
All functions include comprehensive input validation
Owner-only functions are protected with authorization checks
Voting periods prevent indefinite proposal states
Double-voting prevention through vote tracking
Secure fund handling with contract-controlled transfers
